# Tailwind CSS and Next.js Portfolio

This is my quick skin of a portfolio template. You can use the instructionals below to re-create it for yourself.

## How it works

Fork or download the repo and change whatever you need to change for your needs.

## Running Locally

Can run the application in VS Code or a terminal and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
